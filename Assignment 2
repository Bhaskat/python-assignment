1.
Cassandra is a high performance 
and highly scalable distributed 
NoSQL database management 
system.
RDBMS is a Database 
management system or 
software which is designed for 
relational databases.
2.
Cassandra is a NoSQL database.
RDBMS uses SQL for querying 
and maintaining the database.
3.
It deals with unstructured data.
It deals with structured data.
4.
It has a flexible schema.
It has fixed schema.
5.
Cassandra has peer-to-peer 
architecture with no single point of 
failure.
RDBMS has master-slave core 
architecture means a single 
point of failure.
6.
Cassandra handles high volume 
incoming data velocity.
RDBMS handles moderate 
incoming data velocity.
7.
In RDBMS there is limited data 
source means data come from 
many locations.
In Cassandra there are various 
data source means data come 
from one/few location.
8.
It supports simple transactions.
It supports complex and nested 
transactions.
9.
In Cassandra the outermost 
container is Keyspace.
In RDBMS the outermost 
container is database.
10.
Cassandra follows decentralized 
deployments.
RDBMS follows centralized 
deployments.
11.
In Cassandra data written in many 
locations.
In RDBMS mainly data are then replicate entire website content 
elsewhere
• There is minor difference that Image 
scraping works on media content where as 
web scarping works on all the data 
3.) Explain how MongoDB indexes data.
• MongoDB uses multikey indexes to index 
the content stored in arrays. If you index a 
field that holds an array value, MongoDB 
creates separate index entries for every 
element of the array. These multikey 
indexes allow queries to select documents 
that contain arrays by matching on element 
or elements of the arrays.
4.) What is the significance of the SET modifier?
• Set expressions are used to define the scope 
of a calculation. The central part of the set 
expression is the set modifier that specifies 
a selection. This is used to modify the user 
selection, or the selection in the set 
identifier, and the result defines a new 
scope for the calculation
written in one location.S
